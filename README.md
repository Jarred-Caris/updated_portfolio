## My contribution

For this page, i was initially going to be modifying my week 2 homework portfolio page. After some trialling, i was unhappy with how it was progressing and elected to start from scratch. I rebuilt the page from the ground up using Html, CSS and bootstrap for the framework.

I started looking at using JS for some added functionality but felt for the project, it was an uneeded addition. I learnt some new styling techniques which have really given the page a more updated look.


**explaining my page**

Im very pleased with my page. I feel its my most asthetically pleasing page to date and im happy with the overall look. 

I felt with the first portfolio, there was a lot of wasted space with the multiple page format. I elected to contain most of the information on a single page with a link to my resume on a seperate file due to its size.

I feel this gave the page a little more character and looked at what other developers were doing. i also wanted to add animations and a few other things but ran short on time so some features were unfortunately left out.
